 This is a unique identifier (each one is different) for each row in a table. It can be a single column, or a combination of multiple columns. A primary key that is made up of 2 or more columns is called a *composite key*. 

Because it needs to be a unique identifier, it cannot be [[NULL]].

A primary key can be used as a [[FOREIGN KEY]] in another database.
