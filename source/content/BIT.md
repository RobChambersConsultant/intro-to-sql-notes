`BIT` is a binary [[TYPE]] in SQL meaning it can only take True/False or 1/0 values. Basically a yes or no type.

For example, if you have a table of employee schedules, you might have a `BIT` type column called `approved_annual_leave` to tell you whether or not an employee has approved annual leave on that day.
