`CHAR` is an alphanumeric SQL type that takes an [[INTEGER]] type as input. It returns a *character* according to the *ASCII number code*.

*NOTE: This is not needed for the exam.*


I may be lying here - it could be used to define a string of a fixed length but the internet doesn't seem to be clear on this one./'
